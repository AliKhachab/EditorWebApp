# Editor Web App Project

## My first project with HTML and CSS 

This is a project I'm working on to learn HTML and CSS and work on self-teaching frontend over time. I worked with frontend a bit with P5.js back in highschool, but I never got to use it with JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, etc. Having a [graphic design background](https://www.behance.net/theslime) definitely helps out a bit when seeing how things are meant to be laid out.

## What the project is for

It's a basic photo-editing web app similar to stuff like Canva. It's basically all frontend stuff to practice HTML and CSS before I move onto stuff like TailwindCSS and React.
